# smb-ops-ui

Vue 3 Single Page Application for SMB Operations

## Architectural Framework

This application is built with Vue 3, TypeScript, and Vite, strictly organized according to [Feature-Sliced Design (FSD)](https://feature-sliced.design/):

* `src/app/`: Application-wide configurations, routers, and global providers.
* `src/pages/`: Route-level composition views.
* `src/features/`: User-facing interactions and domain actions.
* `src/entities/`: Domain entities and state stores (Pinia).
* `src/shared/`: Reusable UI components, typed API client adapters, and utilities (strictly pure, no imports from outer layers).

Architectural boundaries are enforced via `eslint-plugin-boundaries` and Vitest architectural compliance suites.
