# 1. Context and Problem Statement

Frontend single-page applications require architectural boundaries to prevent component coupling, cyclic dependencies, and leaky abstractions between views, stores, and backend API calls.

# 2. Decision Outcome

We adopt Feature-Sliced Design (FSD) architecture:
* `app/`: Initialization and global routing.
* `pages/`: Page-level composition.
* `features/`: User interaction logic.
* `entities/`: Domain entities and stores.
* `shared/`: Pure UI components, utility libraries, and typed API adapters.

Enforced deterministically by `eslint-plugin-boundaries` and Vitest architectural boundary assertions.
